# Iris Species Classification

This project classifies iris species based on the famous Iris dataset. It uses a machine learning model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. This project is useful for demonstrating fundamental machine learning techniques in classification.

## Overview

The Iris Classification project utilizes the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 records of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each record is labeled with one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. The goal is to train a model that accurately predicts the species based on these measurements. This project is a common introduction to supervised learning and classification in machine learning.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the Iris dataset to make it suitable for training.
- **Model Training**: Train a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or K-Nearest Neighbors.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data and output metrics such as accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
